🚧 PotholeAI — Road Health Intelligence System

AI-powered road damage detection & geospatial mapping platform built with Computer Vision and Deep Learning.

🌍 Overview

PotholeAI is a smart road infrastructure monitoring system that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect potholes from road images and map them in real time.

The platform combines:

🧠 Computer Vision (CNN-based classification)

🗺️ Geospatial mapping (Folium + GPS integration)

📊 Severity scoring & confidence analytics

📱 Mobile-first responsive UI

📥 Automated CSV reporting

This project is designed to scale from a web-based prototype to a vehicle-integrated road safety system and smart city infrastructure solution.

🧠 Model Architecture

The CNN model uses:

Conv2D Layers

MaxPooling Layers

Dense Layers

Sigmoid activation (binary classification)

Binary Crossentropy loss

Adam optimizer

Input size: 128x128x3

📸 How It Works

User enters road location OR coordinates.

Location is geocoded to latitude & longitude.

User uploads road images.

CNN processes each image.

Model predicts pothole probability.

Severity is calculated from confidence.

Pins appear on live map.

Results can be downloaded as CSV.
